<p>What do you see when you look around you? If you are reading this at a desk on a computer monitor, you probably have a keyboard and mouse before you, maybe there is a coffee mug next to it. The world, as we experience it, consists of objects and every object has (at least one) color.</p>
<p>But objects are not the only thing that have a color. Your desk will be illuminated by natural light from a window or a light bulb above you. We only see objects when light shines on them and they appear illuminated to us. The perceived illumination has a strength and a color.</p>
<p>Here it is important to note that the color is not a physical property of the object or the light, it is a perceptual property. The physical attributes, the spectrum of light and the reflectance attributes of an object, are the basis, but not equivalent to our perception. The physics of light is still important but not sufficient to understand color perception, or visual perception in general.</p>
<h2 id="the-stages-of-color-perception">The stages of color perception</h2>
<p>Now let us look at the stages involved in color perception.</p>
<ol>
<li>
A light source sends out electromagnetic waves.
</li>
<li>
An object partially absorbs, scatters, and reflects the waves.
</li>
<li>
The reflected light rays excite the photoreceptors in the retina at the back of the eye.
</li>
<li>
The signal from the retina is processed in the visual areas of the brain to arrive at ...
</li>
<li>
... our visual perception.
</li>
</ol>
