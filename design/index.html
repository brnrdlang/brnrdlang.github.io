<p><img src="../resources/fonts.svg" alt="My personal font for my watermarks"></p>
<p>I created this font as an exercise on how to design and create fonts with FontForge. The goal was a font that I could use for my personal watermarks on photos and drawings. I started out with a sketch of the watermark I wanted and designed the rest from there. There are two versions of the font, the regular version and the watermark version, which exchanges the A for the achromatic logo.</p>
